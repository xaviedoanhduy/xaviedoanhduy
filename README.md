  <strong>✨ According to all known laws of aviation,</strong><br>
  there is <span style="color:#ff0000;">no way</span> a bee should be able to fly.<br>
  Its wings are <em style="color:#0099ff;">too small</em> to get its fat little body off the ground.<br>
  The bee, of course, <span style="color:#00cc66;"><strong>flies anyway</strong></span>,<br>
  because bees don't care what humans think is <span style="color:#ff9900;">impossible</span>. 🐝💫
